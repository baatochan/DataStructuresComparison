# Data Structures Comparison
Implementation of basic data structures for comparison of how fast they perform.
Project done as a task during Data Structures and Computational Complexity (Struktury danych i złożoność obliczeniowa) course at the University.

Author: Bartosz Rodziewicz

There is implementation of Array, List, Heap and Binary Search Tree (with DSW algorithm).

All of the structure classes inherit after Structure class.

The Program class is the main menu.
