# Data Structures Comparison
Implementation of basic data structures for comparison of how fast they perform.
Project done as a task during Data Structures and Computational Complexity (Struktury danych i złożoność obliczeniowa) course at the University.

There are two releases of this app:
* `v1.0` has implementation of Array, List, Heap and Binary Search Tree (with DSW algorithm). However the implementation of heap is broken.
* `v2.1` only has implementation of Array, List and Heap. There is a lot of small fixes and improvements to those structures in comparison to `v1.0`.

All of the structure classes inherit after Structure class.

The Program class is the main menu.

The app has console UI.
